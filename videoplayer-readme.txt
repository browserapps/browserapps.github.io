Chromebook Video Player - User Guide
=======================================

This document provides instructions for using all features of the Chromebook Video Player.

---

LOADING MEDIA
-------------

You can load media files in three ways:

* Click: Click the "Open Files" button to select video (.mp4, .mkv) and/or subtitle (.srt) files from your device.
* Drag & Drop: Drag and drop your video or subtitle files directly onto the player window.
* Paste: Copy a video file (e.g., from your file manager) and press Ctrl+V to paste it directly into the player.

Subtitle Auto-loading:
If a .srt subtitle file has the exact same name as your video file (e.g., "my-video.mp4" and "my-video.srt"), it will be loaded automatically with the video.
